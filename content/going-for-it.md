In true form, I have procrastinated developing a site like this for quite a while. Like a contractor whose house is always in disrepair, I am a developer whose site has had it's foundation built, torn apart and rebuilt a dizzying amount of times. All the while I have been living in a leased trailer on my small patch of internet.

So today I am breaking this cycle and getting some content up regardless of its form or its underlying architecture. I am pretty excited about the library I have been developing for this and other projects as it is a culmination of a few years of on and off work and represents a manifestation of what i think is an important trajectory for the practice of design and development.

Hereâ€™s to using prose as a method to solidify thoughts, hone craftsmanship, and convert my stockpile of notational velocity files and code snippets into something a little more useful.

I can't promise things won't get super random though. Maybe check my twitter feed if you don't know me before adding my feed to your rss reader...
